# Money Goals

Categorise your money into achievable goals.

## Update your account balance

This can be done once a month - when your paycheck comes in, or anytime when your account balance has changed. Click on the amount to change it.

## Unallocated funds

This is the amount that are not allocated to any goals yet, which means you can spend it freely! But be careful not to spend more than it.

## Add a new goal

Add a financial goal such as a trip to Japan / wedding / car / house down payment along with its target. This can be changed later.

## Working towards your goal

Once the goal is created, tap on its name to add funds towards it. You can also change its name and target. The progress bar will change accordingly.
